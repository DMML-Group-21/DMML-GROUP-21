As interesting as the Image and Audio \nprocessing datasets are, they seem to include a lot more data than we \nwould like to work with. We decided to use the US Accidents dataset as \nit seemed to be a sophisticated alternative and it has a lot of interesting \nattributes such as severity of the accident, effects on traffic flow, \npinpoint location, length of road affected, a human provided \ndescription of the accident, and many more specific details to ensure a \nthorough examination of the data. As of now we have multiple use-\ncases for the dataset in mind such as:\n Real-time accident prediction\n Analysis for any casualties\n Correlation between environmental conditions and accidents\n Accident hotspots/hazard zones\nThe dataset contains 2,845,342 different recorded accidents. With this \ndata, every use-case mentioned above could be completed with precise \naccuracy.\n",
